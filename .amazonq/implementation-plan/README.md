# Amazon Q CLI Custom Commands Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding custom command functionality to Amazon Q CLI through a new `/commands` slash command. This feature will allow users to define reusable commands stored in either global (`~/.amazonq/commands`) or local (`.amazonq/commands`) scope, similar to the existing `/context` command pattern.

```

## Quick Start

1. **Read Architecture**: Start with `architecture/00-system-overview.md`
2. **Review Design**: Check `design/00-user-experience.md` for UX flow
3. **Implementation**: Follow `implementation/00-development-phases.md`
4. **Track Progress**: Update `progress/status.md` regularly

## Key Principles

- **Incremental Development**: Work can be interrupted and resumed at any point
- **Network Safe**: All changes are atomic and can be safely committed
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow existing `/context` command patterns
- **Scope Flexibility**: Support both global and local command definitions
- **Security First**: Secure command execution with proper validation

## Next Steps

1. Review all architecture documents
2. Validate design decisions with stakeholders
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Update progress tracking regularly
