# Development Phases - Custom Commands Implementation

## Overview

The custom commands feature will be implemented in three phases, each building upon the previous phase. This approach allows for incremental development, testing, and deployment while maintaining the ability to pause and resume work at any point.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)

### Objectives
- Establish basic command management infrastructure
- Implement file storage and loading mechanisms
- Create minimal CLI interface for command operations
- Set up testing framework

### Deliverables

#### 1.1 Data Structures and Models
- [ ] `CustomCommand` struct definition
- [ ] `CommandConfig` struct definition  
- [ ] `CommandManager` struct definition
- [ ] `CommandMetadata` struct definition
- [ ] Serialization/deserialization implementations
- [ ] Unit tests for all data structures

#### 1.2 File System Operations
- [ ] Command file discovery (global and local scopes)
- [ ] Markdown file parsing and validation
- [ ] Metadata file management (.metadata.json)
- [ ] File watching for cache invalidation
- [ ] Error handling for file operations
- [ ] Integration tests for file operations

#### 1.3 Basic CLI Interface
- [ ] `/commands` subcommand structure using clap
- [ ] `show` subcommand implementation
- [ ] `list` subcommand implementation
- [ ] Basic command resolution logic
- [ ] Integration with existing chat CLI
- [ ] CLI unit tests

#### 1.4 Command Manager Core
- [ ] `CommandManager::new()` implementation
- [ ] Command loading and caching
- [ ] Scope resolution (local overrides global)
- [ ] Basic validation framework
- [ ] Error handling and reporting
- [ ] Manager integration tests

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can view available commands with `/commands show`
- [ ] Commands are properly loaded from both global and local directories
- [ ] Local commands override global commands with same name
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% code coverage
- [ ] Documentation is complete and up-to-date

### Risk Mitigation
- **File System Complexity**: Start with simple file operations, add complexity incrementally
- **Integration Issues**: Regular integration testing with existing codebase
- **Performance Concerns**: Implement basic caching from the start

## Phase 2: Command Execution and Management (Weeks 4-6)

### Objectives
- Implement command execution engine
- Add command creation and editing capabilities
- Integrate with Amazon Q chat system
- Enhance security and validation

### Deliverables

#### 2.1 Command Execution Engine
- [ ] `CommandExecutor` implementation
- [ ] Integration with `ChatSession`
- [ ] Context injection for commands
- [ ] Streaming response handling
- [ ] Timeout and resource management
- [ ] Execution logging and metrics

#### 2.2 Command CRUD Operations
- [ ] `add` subcommand with interactive creation
- [ ] `edit` subcommand with editor integration
- [ ] `remove` subcommand with confirmation
- [ ] `import` subcommand for external commands
- [ ] `export` subcommand for sharing commands
- [ ] Validation during creation/editing

#### 2.3 Security and Validation
- [ ] `CommandValidator` implementation
- [ ] Content sanitization and security checks
- [ ] Size and complexity limits
- [ ] Malicious pattern detection
- [ ] User consent for sensitive operations
- [ ] Security audit logging

#### 2.4 Enhanced CLI Features
- [ ] `run` subcommand implementation
- [ ] `validate` subcommand implementation
- [ ] Command auto-completion support
- [ ] Improved error messages and help text
- [ ] Progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Interactive command creation wizard

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can create, edit, and delete commands
- [ ] Commands execute successfully through Amazon Q
- [ ] Security validation prevents malicious commands
- [ ] Command execution integrates seamlessly with chat
- [ ] All CRUD operations work reliably
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds

### Risk Mitigation
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Comprehensive security testing and validation
- **Performance Issues**: Profiling and optimization during development
- **User Experience**: Regular UX testing and feedback collection

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polish (Weeks 7-9)

### Objectives
- Add advanced command features
- Implement usage analytics and optimization
- Enhance user experience and discoverability
- Prepare for production deployment

### Deliverables

#### 3.1 Advanced Command Features
- [ ] Command parameters and arguments support
- [ ] Command templates and scaffolding
- [ ] Command dependencies and chaining
- [ ] Conditional execution logic
- [ ] Environment variable support
- [ ] Pre/post execution hooks

#### 3.2 Analytics and Optimization
- [ ] Usage statistics tracking
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Command recommendation system
- [ ] Cache optimization and tuning
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (optional)

#### 3.3 Enhanced User Experience
- [ ] Command search and filtering
- [ ] Tag-based organization
- [ ] Command sharing and collaboration
- [ ] Improved help and documentation
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts and aliases
- [ ] Visual command builder (optional)

#### 3.4 Production Readiness
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Logging and monitoring integration
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Migration tools for existing users
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature-complete implementation matching design specifications
- [ ] Production-ready code quality and reliability
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical issues
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed successfully

### Risk Mitigation
- **Feature Creep**: Strict scope management and prioritization
- **Quality Issues**: Continuous integration and automated testing
- **Performance Degradation**: Regular performance monitoring and optimization

## Cross-Phase Considerations

### Continuous Integration
- Automated testing on every commit
- Code quality checks (clippy, rustfmt)
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Performance regression testing
- Documentation generation and validation

### Documentation Strategy
- API documentation with rustdoc
- User guide and tutorials
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Troubleshooting and FAQ
- Migration guides

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for major workflows
- End-to-end tests for user scenarios
- Performance and load testing
- Security and penetration testing

### Deployment Strategy
