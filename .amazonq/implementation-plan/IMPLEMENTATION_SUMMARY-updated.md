# Custom Commands Implementation Plan - Executive Summary (Updated for Consistency)

## Project Overview

**Feature**: Custom Commands for Amazon Q CLI (Consistent with Knowledge Base UX)
**Timeline**: 8.5 weeks (3 phases) - Optimized with knowledge base pattern reuse
**Complexity**: Medium-High (reduced due to pattern consistency)
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium (reduced due to established patterns)

## What We're Building

A comprehensive custom command system that follows Amazon Q CLI's established patterns (specifically the knowledge base feature), allowing users to define reusable commands stored in project (`.amazonq/commands/`) or user (`~/.amazonq/commands/`) scope.

### Key Capabilities (Consistent with Knowledge Base)
- **Settings Integration**: Feature enablement via `q settings chat.enableCommands true`
- **Dual Interface**: Management commands (`/commands show`) + execution syntax (`/project:name`)
- **Scope Management**: Project vs user commands with consistent precedence rules
- **Security Model**: Tool permissions and user consent (same security level as knowledge base)
- **File Organization**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in structured directories
- **Status Tracking**: Progress indicators and operation status (consistent visual style)

## Architecture Approach (Aligned with Knowledge Base)

### Pattern Consistency
Following the knowledge base implementation patterns:
- **Settings Integration**: Same `Setting` enum pattern with `EnabledCommands`
- **Tool Registration**: Same tool registration and permission evaluation
- **File Storage**: Similar directory structure and metadata management
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error messages and user feedback
- **CLI Interface**: Same command structure and help system

### Implementation Structure
```
crates/chat-cli/src/
├── cli/chat/tools/commands.rs      # Tool implementation (like knowledge.rs)
├── cli/chat/cli/commands.rs        # CLI commands (like knowledge.rs)
├── util/command_manager.rs         # Core logic (like knowledge_store.rs)
└── database/settings.rs            # Settings integration (existing)
```

### Dual Interface Design (Consistent with Knowledge Base)
1. **Management Interface**: `/commands show|add|remove|update|clear|status`
2. **Execution Interface**: `/project:name` and `/user:name` 
3. **Settings Integration**: `q settings chat.enableCommands true`
4. **Unified Backend**: Single command manager following knowledge base patterns

## Implementation Strategy (Optimized)

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3) - Reduced from 3.5 weeks
**Goal**: Establish foundation using knowledge base patterns
- Reuse settings integration patterns from knowledge base
- Command manager following KnowledgeStore singleton pattern
- File-based storage with metadata (similar to knowledge base)
- Basic CLI interface following `/knowledge` command patterns
- Tool registration using existing ToolManager patterns

**Deliverable**: Users can view, list, and manage commands with consistent UX

### Phase 2: Command Execution (Weeks 4-6) - Reduced from 6.5 weeks  
**Goal**: Implement execution features with security
- Argument processing and template substitution
- Bash execution with tool permissions (following knowledge base security model)
- File reference handling with existing file system abstractions
- Direct command execution integration
- CRUD operations with consistent error handling

**Deliverable**: Full command execution with security controls

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polish (Weeks 7-8.5) - Reduced from 9.5 weeks
**Goal**: Production readiness and enhanced features
- Advanced command templates and validation
- Usage analytics and command recommendations
- Enhanced discoverability and help system
- Performance optimization and comprehensive testing
- Documentation and user onboarding

**Deliverable**: Production-ready system with advanced features

## Technical Decisions (Leveraging Knowledge Base Patterns)

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Settings Pattern**: Reuse `Setting` enum and database integration
2. **Tool Integration**: Follow exact knowledge base tool registration pattern
3. **File Organization**: Similar directory structure with `.metadata.json`
4. **Security Model**: Same permission evaluation level as knowledge base
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent error messages and user feedback patterns
6. **Caching Strategy**: File watching and lazy loading like knowledge base

### Technology Stack (Consistent)
- **Language**: Rust (existing codebase)
- **CLI Framework**: clap (existing, same as knowledge base)
- **Serialization**: serde (existing, same as knowledge base)
- **File Operations**: Existing `Os` abstraction (same as knowledge base)
- **Settings**: Existing settings database (same as knowledge base)

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation (Reduced Risks)

### Medium Risks (Reduced from High)
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Custom command execution
   - *Mitigation*: Reuse knowledge base security patterns, established permission model

2. **Integration Complexity**: Deep integration with existing chat system
   - *Mitigation*: Follow knowledge base integration patterns exactly

### Low Risks (Reduced from Medium)
1. **Performance Impact**: File I/O and parsing overhead
   - *Mitigation*: Reuse knowledge base caching and file watching patterns

2. **User Experience**: Complex feature with many options
   - *Mitigation*: Follow knowledge base UX patterns exactly
