# Custom Commands Implementation Plan - Executive Summary (Updated)

## Project Overview

**Feature**: Claude Code Compatible Custom Commands for Amazon Q CLI
**Timeline**: 9.5 weeks (3 phases) - Extended for Claude Code feature parity
**Complexity**: High (increased from Medium-High)
**Risk Level**: Medium

## What We're Building

A comprehensive custom command system compatible with Claude Code's slash command syntax, allowing users to define reusable commands stored in project (`.amazonq/commands/`) or user (`~/.amazonq/commands/`) scope. The system supports both Claude Code execution syntax and Amazon Q management commands.

### Key Capabilities
- **Claude Code Compatibility**: Full syntax compatibility (`/project:name`, `/user:namespace:name`)
- **Dual Interface**: Execution syntax + management commands (`/commands show`, `/commands add`)
- **Advanced Features**: Arguments (`$ARGUMENTS`), bash execution (`!`), file references (`@`)
- **Security Model**: Tool permissions via YAML frontmatter (`allowed-tools`)
- **Namespace Support**: Directory-based command organization
- **Rich Metadata**: YAML frontmatter with descriptions, tool permissions, thinking mode

## Architecture Approach

### Claude Code Pattern Integration
Following Claude Code's established patterns:
- **Execution Syntax**: `/project:command-name args` and `/user:namespace:command args`
- **File Organization**: Directory-based namespacing with `.md` files
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Metadata including `allowed-tools`, `description`, `thinking-mode`
- **Dynamic Features**: `$ARGUMENTS` substitution, `!bash-command` execution, `@file-reference`
- **Security**: Tool permission validation and user consent

### Dual Interface Design
1. **Claude Code Execution**: Direct command execution with arguments
2. **Amazon Q Management**: Traditional CLI management interface
3. **Unified Backend**: Single command manager handling both syntaxes

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3.5) - Extended
**Goal**: Establish foundation with Claude Code compatibility
- Enhanced data structures for namespaces and frontmatter
- YAML frontmatter parsing and validation
- Namespace resolution from directory structure
- Dual syntax CLI interface (execution + management)
- Command manager with scope resolution

**Deliverable**: Users can view, list, and discover commands with full namespace support

### Phase 2: Command Execution and Management (Weeks 4-6.5) - Extended
**Goal**: Full Claude Code feature implementation
- Argument processing with `$ARGUMENTS` substitution
- Bash command execution with `!` prefix and tool permissions
- File reference handling with `@` prefix
- Tool permission manager and security validation
- Direct command execution integration
- Enhanced CRUD operations

**Deliverable**: Full Claude Code feature parity with secure execution

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polish (Weeks 7-9.5) - Extended
**Goal**: Production readiness and Amazon Q enhancements
- Advanced command templates and scaffolding
- Usage analytics and command recommendations
- Enhanced user experience and discoverability
- Migration tools from Claude Code
- Production hardening and comprehensive testing

**Deliverable**: Production-ready system with advanced Amazon Q integrations

## Technical Decisions

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Markdown Format**: Human-readable command definitions
2. **Local Override**: Local commands take precedence over global
3. **Security-First**: Multi-layered security with user consent
4. **Caching Strategy**: In-memory caching with file system watching
5. **Integration Pattern**: Follow existing ContextManager integration

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust (existing codebase)
- **CLI Framework**: clap (existing)
- **Serialization**: serde (existing)
- **File Operations**: Existing `Os` abstraction
- **Testing**: Standard Rust testing with integration tests

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Custom command execution
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive security validation, user consent, audit logging

2. **Integration Complexity**: Deep integration with existing chat system
   - *Mitigation*: Follow established patterns, incremental integration testing

### Medium Risks
1. **Performance Impact**: File I/O and parsing overhead
   - *Mitigation*: Caching strategy, performance benchmarking

2. **User Experience**: Complex feature with many options
   - *Mitigation*: Follow existing UX patterns, user testing

### Low Risks
1. **File System Compatibility**: Cross-platform file operations
   - *Mitigation*: Use existing `Os` abstraction, comprehensive testing

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can view available commands with `/commands show` (management syntax)
- [ ] Commands load from both project and user directories with namespace support
- [ ] Claude Code execution syntax parsing works (`/project:name`, `/user:namespace:name`)
- [ ] YAML frontmatter parsing extracts metadata and tool permissions
- [ ] Namespace resolution from directory structure functions correctly
- [ ] >90% test coverage
- [ ] Complete documentation with Claude Code examples

### Overall Success Criteria
- [ ] Full Claude Code feature compatibility
- [ ] Production-ready code quality and security
- [ ] >95% test coverage including security scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met with complex command execution
- [ ] Security audit passed for bash execution and file access
- [ ] User acceptance testing with Claude Code migration scenarios
- [ ] Tool permission system validates and enforces security policies
